# UEFI-SCT Project

The UEFI Self-Certification Test (UEFI SCT) is a toolset
for platform developers to validate firmware implementation
compliance to the UEFI Specification from www.uefi.org.
The toolset features a Test Harness for executing
built-in UEFI Compliance Tests, as well as for integrating
user-defined tests that were developed using the
UEFI SCT open source code.
